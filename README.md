challenges
==========

## Communication

Use a separate mailing list (maybe a google group?) to communicate so that we can share experiences, ask for help and raise questions without messing with the meetup list. Additionally we may have,

* Announcements in meetup main list
* Meetups & dojos
* Github-based communication (this ;))

## Microchallenges

Small challenges proposed on a weekly basis to learn scala and their basic concepts. These must be able to be solved without too much trouble and should let to compare different approaches and learn from each other. Several sources,

* [s99](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99) and [tests](https://github.com/jsuereth/scala-99-puzzles/blob/master/src/test/scala/suereth/TestNinetyNine.scala)

## Monthly challenges

More demanding challenges aimed to create pet (or even real) applications using state-of-the-art frameworks or technologies. First ones could be done individually and more complex ones by small teams. Each month a new challenge is going to be proposed and afterwards the experience shared in one (or more) meet ups. Current list,

### Flyapp

An application that presents arrival/departure information for a given airport to users.

* RESTful API
* Data persistence
* Free text parser
* Data feed from custom sources
* Pushing data to browsers/apps
* Twitter integration

### Retweetservice

challenges
==========

This repo is a work in progress. For the moment it'll be a compendium of challenges suggested to all scala developers. this is being managed and maintaind by [scala dev bcn](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Developers-Barcelona/).

## [Microchallenges](./micro/)

Small challenges proposed on a weekly basis to learn scala and their basic concepts. These must be able to be solved without too much trouble and should let to compare different approaches and learn from each other.

## [Monthly challenges](./monthly/)

More demanding challenges aimed to create pet (or even real) applications using state-of-the-art frameworks or technologies. First ones could be done individually and more complex ones by small teams. Each month a new challenge is going to be proposed and afterwards the experience shared in one (or more) meet ups. 

## APPENDIX

We're using a Google Group (https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/scala-developers-barcelona) separate from the meetup mailing lists as a dedicated communication channel for challenges. This way we can share experiences, ask for help and raise questions without messing with the meetup list. 

Additionally to the challenges we may have,

* Announcements in meetup main list
* Meetups & dojos

So stop by [scala dev bcn](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Developers-Barcelona/) and join!
